For the functions, I referred to the 'Time Server' exercise in LearnYouNode.

I referred to Stackoverflow to find how to grab the pathname (req.params.filepath): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18931452/node-js-get-path-from-the-request

After many attempts, I asked Jeff (our TA) how to tweak the req.params to grab the variable given at the end of the url.

For Chai, I mostly went of off Tyler's Mocha practice in class.
